FAQ
============================

####Â How do I build it?

You will need an installation of [Go](http://golang.org) (version >= 1.1.1) available on your PATH, as well as a version of Ruby with rake. Personally I've had great success using [jruby](http://jruby.org/).

To build the project you need to run ````rake```` from the root of this repository, this will

1. Fetch dependencies
2. Setup folders
3. Build the project

On Windows and OSX you shouldn't have to do anything more then that as I've included the shared libraries this project needs to build with (glew and GLFW)

However on Linux you will need to have libGLEW and libglfw installed.

Builds have been tested on the following systems, note that these are all 64-bit

* OSX Mountain Lion (10.5.8)
* Ubuntu Linux 13.04
* Windows 7
