TODO
---------------------------
1. Windowing -> currently no windowing is rendered
2. 8x16 sprites -> I'm not sure how these work yet
3. Investigate scrolling bug, there are some issues with the drawing code that I think are connected to scrolling, might need to rewrite to fix
4. MBC1 RAM saving -> allow users to save games!
5. MBC2 -> to implement
6. MBC3 -> partially implemented but needs work
7. Color -> no gameboy color features are supported yet
8. MBC4 -> to implement
9. MBC5 -> to implement
10. Sound -> looks tricky, but lower priority to the above
