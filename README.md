Term Boy
========

Term Boy is a Nintendo Game Boy emulator...for your terminal.

This is an early implementation written in Go.
A more complete version (written in C++) is available [here](http://github.com/dobyrch/termboy).

This project is based on code from an existing Game Boy Color emulator, [gomeboycolor](http://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor).
