FreeBSD
=======

*See <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/consoles.html> for instructions on
 how to change the resolution of the console.

*Currently the directory ~/.config/termboy must be created manually; the logic
 responsible for setting up 'SettingsDir' in config.go needs fixing.

*More research on setting the console font to a smaller size is needed.

*Need to look into conditional compilation of C code using Go
